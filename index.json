Most terms and suggestions in these guidelines are consistent with each other, although there are some conflicting details, reflecting the underlying uncertainty surrounding the transmission mechanism and characteristics of COVID-19 in buildings. All guidelines emphasize the importance of ventilation, but the specific ventilation rate that can eliminate the risk of transmission of airborne particulate matter has not been established. The most important countermeasure, commonly agreed countermeasures, the conflicting content from different guidelines, and further work have been summarized in this paper.","tags":[],"title":"Review and comparison of HVAC operation guidelines in different countries during the COVID-19 pandemic","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mingyue Guo"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1602374400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1602374400,"objectID":"449ac0498b497e3918dafc2aa28a62ad","permalink":"https://lunaguo.github.io/chinese_publication/heatrecovery/","publishdate":"2021-03-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/chinese_publication/heatrecovery/","section":"chinese_publication","summary":"公开了一种用于火锅店的燃气灶烟气热回收装置,它包括燃烧腔(1)、烟道(2)、容积式换热器(4)和吸式风机(5),燃烧腔1的排气孔连通烟道(2),烟道(2)接入容积式换热器(4)的高温流体入口,容积式换热器(4)的高温流体出口连接吸式风机(5)；冷水从容积式换热器(4)的低温流体入口流入,冷水换热后从容积式换热器(4)的低温流体出口流出。本实用新型减小了余热回收装置的体积、提高了热回收率；改善火锅店的室内环境,降低了火锅店夏季的空调能耗。","tags":[],"title":"一种用于火锅店的燃气灶烟气热回收装置","type":"chinese_publication"},{"authors":["Mingyue Guo"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1602374400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1602374400,"objectID":"d92c1f750a40763df1ea7ec6cbd1457d","permalink":"https://lunaguo.github.io/chinese_publication/bim/","publishdate":"2021-03-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/chinese_publication/bim/","section":"chinese_publication","summary":"通过对若干基于BIM的能耗模拟软件中BIM信息导入过程和软件能耗模拟过程参数设置功能的测评，分析并总结了目前能耗模拟软件在BIM信息读取和转化过程上的功能现状","tags":[],"title":"基于BIM的能耗模拟软件功能的测评分析","type":"chinese_publication"},{"authors":["Mingyue Guo"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1602374400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1602374400,"objectID":"950819fa6d527e117b8cda22cf7fae2b","permalink":"https://lunaguo.github.io/chinese_publication/covid19/","publishdate":"2021-03-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/chinese_publication/covid19/","section":"chinese_publication","summary":"为应对新冠肺炎（COVID-19）和新型冠状病毒（SARS-CoV-2） ，不同机构、学会发布了相关指南。对国内外主要的暖通相关指南或文件进行了解读和对比。包括美国供暖制冷与空调工程师学会ASHRAE、欧洲供暖通风和空调协会联盟REHVA、日本空气调和·卫生工学会及中国建筑学会、中国制冷学会等发布的文件和指南中关于病毒传播机制和暖通空调系统运行建议的部分，以及英国设备工程师协会CIBSE、德国室内通风技术协会RLT根据REHVA指南做出的回应。","tags":[],"title":"应对新型冠状病毒国内外暖通相关指南对比","type":"chinese_publication"},{"authors":["Mingyue Guo"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1602374400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1602374400,"objectID":"4fdf763232ca5b829d74259e1393d4d2","permalink":"https://lunaguo.github.io/chinese_publication/bimtobemcopyright/","publishdate":"2021-03-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/chinese_publication/bimtobemcopyright/","section":"chinese_publication","summary":"BIM向BEM转换软件采用模块化设计，包含四个主要模块（如图1，黄色部分表示模块，绿色部分表中间文件）。软件整体的输入模型为Revit中rvt项目文件（BIM），输出文件为常用的能耗模拟软件EnergyPlus（e+）的输入文件IDF（BEM）。模块一：BIM checker在Revit的环境中运行，对原始的BIM模型进行简化、修改和填补信息，并将BIM转换为中间格式gbXML（Green Building XML）。模块二：gbXML editor将BIM直接转换的存在信息不规范的gbXML进行修改，输出修改后的gbXML。模块三：data converter将修改后的gbXML进行数据格式转换，输出能耗模拟引擎EnergyPlus的支持的格式IDF（Input Data File）。模块四：IDF checker将转换得到的IDF根据国家现行规范进行修改和补充，输出可直接用于能耗分析的IDF文件。","tags":[],"title":"建筑信息模型向建筑能耗模型转换软件（BIMtoBEM）","type":"chinese_publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"It is a task regarding a VAV control system with Johnson control in a team of 4 people.

Thus, it becomes a popular topic in both the research and the industrial society in recent years. However, there are no tools that can smoothly accomplish the transformation of a complex BIM to a reliable BEM. The biggest obstacle of BIM to BEM is the deviation of geometrical information, which can be summarized in two main aspects. One is the inaccurate information caused by the original BIM, another is the information deviation among BIM, intermedia files and BEM.

The accuracy of building energy consumption prediction is of top priority for the electricity market management to ensure grid safety and reduce financial risks. The accuracy and speed of load prediction are fundamental prerequisites for different objectives such as long-term planning and short-term optimization of energy systems in buildings and the power grid. The past few decades have seen the impressive development of time series load forecasting models focusing on different domains and objectives. This paper presents an in-depth review and discussion of building energy prediction models. Three widely used prediction approaches, namely, building physical energy models (i.e., white box), data-driven models (i.e., black box), and hybrid models (i.e., grey box), were classified and introduced. The principles, advantages, limitations, and practical applications of each model were investigated. Based on this review, the research priorities and future directions in the domain of building energy prediction are highlighted. The conclusions drawn in this review could guide the future development of building energy prediction, and therefore facilitate the energy management and efficiency of buildings. ","tags":[],"title":"Physical energy and data-driven models in building energy prediction: A review","type":"publication"}]
