In this paper, heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning-related guidelines or documents in several major countries and regions have been reviewed and compared, including those issued by the American Society of Heating Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers, the Federation of European Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning Associations, the Society of Heating, Air-Conditioning and Sanitary Engineers of Japan, Architectural Society of China, and the Chinese Institute of Refrigeration. Most terms and suggestions in these guidelines are consistent with each other, although there are some conflicting details, reflecting the underlying uncertainty surrounding the transmission mechanism and characteristics of COVID-19 in buildings. All guidelines emphasize the importance of ventilation, but the specific ventilation rate that can eliminate the risk of transmission of airborne particulate matter has not been established. The most important countermeasure, commonly agreed countermeasures, the conflicting content from different guidelines, and further work have been summarized in this paper.","tags":[],"title":"Review and comparison of HVAC operation guidelines in different countries during the COVID-19 pandemic","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"It is a task regarding a VAV control system with Johnson control in a team of 4 people.

Thus, it becomes a popular topic in both the research and the industrial society in recent years. However, there are no tools that can smoothly accomplish the transformation of a complex BIM to a reliable BEM. The biggest obstacle of BIM to BEM is the deviation of geometrical information, which can be summarized in two main aspects. One is the inaccurate information caused by the original BIM, another is the information deviation among BIM, intermedia files and BEM. A more robust method based on gbXML that can check, simplify and correct some complex geometric information is proposed in this paper.","tags":[],"title":"Building energy modelling based on building information modelling: the remaining problems and a more robust method","type":"publication"}]
